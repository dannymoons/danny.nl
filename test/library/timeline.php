    <p class="mb-0 p-4">So I was 12 years old an had my first week of school at A. Roland Holst College. Here we got music lessons from Stef van Dijk. He gave me a guitar and told me to play the bassline of <em>Hit the Road, Jack!</em>
    And so I did. I was sold immediately.. I decided I wanted to become a lead guitar player and searched for a teacher. I ended up with Franc Tijdink, a true rock legend from the low lands.</p>

    <p class="mb-0 p-4">After two months of practicing 2 hrs a day I bought my second guitar. And so the long road of hard rock, metal and screaming solos started... Frank teached me how to play songs like <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em>
      and <em>Sweet Child 'o Mine</em>. At this point I was practicing around 4 hrs a day.</p>

    <p class="text-muted px-4 mb-0"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2009</p>
    <p class="mb-0 p-4">In 2009 I was asked by my school's music teacher to be the lead guitarist in Jesus Christ Superstar, our school musical. It felt like a dreame come true.
    I happily said yes and also entered the school band. I learned a lot from playing with other musicians in both projects. I meat some musicians and friends here some of which I still play music with.</p>

    <p class="text-muted px-4 mb-0"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2010</p>
    <p class="mb-0 p-4">At Jesus Christ Superstar I meat <em>Mats Gorter</em>, a friend and also a multi instrumentalist. He told me he was running a band and that they needed a bass player.
      Alhough I had never touched a bass before I was eager to play in his band. And so story of Evil Plan begins. A story that goes on for 8 years.
      In that time we wrote a lot of songs, played many gigs and touched the holy grounds of Paradiso (2 times!). Those 8 years have formed me in many ways and I'm very glad that I've experienced these exciting things with some very special people.</p>

    <p class="text-muted px-4 mb-0"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2018</p>
    <p class="mb-0 p-4">So in 2018 I had basicly messed up my relationship with my guitars.. They stood there while my bass got all attention.
      Until <em>Matthias ten Houte de Lange, a.k.a. de  Gooische Pianoleraar</em> asked me to play guitar at his Jesus Christ Superstar project. After saying no too many times he asked me one more time and after some beers I finally said yes.
    Thank god I did! With a great group of people, our cast and orchestra, we performed JCS at MCO in Hilversum. This is where <em>Stichting GAAF Muziektheater</em> is born. At this point we have greater goals of playing multiple shows a years,
  teaching childeren music and more.</p>

    <p class="mb-0 p-4">It was time for something new. Something serious. Then I met Moon van Bakelen. A great singer and performer who needed somebody to play some acoustic music. It was a match. Within no-time we had a setlist of 60+ songs
    and played some gigs. We're still making music together and have plans to play some awesome gigs the coming years. </p>
